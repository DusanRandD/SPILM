# SPILM - Single Perceptron with Intiger weights and Local Minium function
This single perceptron consist of one intiger bias and two intiger weights. There is option for using local minimum function that is useful for shortening the training time. It is able to solves simple logical operations like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. It is added the logging functionality of all coefficients, over iteration process, into one text file which can be analyzed later. This algorithm can not resolve XOR or XNOR logical operations.
