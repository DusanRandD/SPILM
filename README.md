# SPILM
This algorithm implements software realization of the smallest unit of artificial neural network. This single perceptron consist of one intiger bias and two intiger weights. There is option for using local minimum function that is useful for shortening the training time. It is able to solves simple logical operations like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. This neural network with only one neural cell have two binary inputs and one output.It is added the logging functionality of all coefficients, over iteration process, into one text file which can be analyzed later. This algorithm can not resolve XOR or XNOR logical operations.
