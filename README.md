# SPILM - Single Perceptron with Integer weights and Local Minium function
This single perceptron consist of one integer bias and two integer weights. There is an option for using the local minimum function that is useful for shortening the training time. It is able to solve simple logical operations like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. It adds the logging functionality of all coefficients, over the iteration process, into one text file which can be analyzed later. This algorithm can not resolve XOR or XNOR logical operations.
